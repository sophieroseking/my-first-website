# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

This is my very first project.
I have used HTML, CSS, Git and Github to complete the different aspects.
I used HTML to give content to the page. Eg links and pictures. Also to set the page layout for example, the nav section.
I used CSS for the styling, choosing colors and text alignment.
Git was used to create a local repository. I added the files for my first website and made comments about what I had done, including any changes.
I then used Git to push the repository (and thus, the content of the files saved in the repository) to GitHub.
